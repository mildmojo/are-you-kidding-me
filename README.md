# Meat makes us go?

[Play Online](http://)

"Meat Makes Us Go?" is a physics puzzle game inspired by the ridiculousness of the human body and @AlBakerKY's surprise at discovering its frailty in a second grade health class. The goal is to drive a ball to the black square exit on the level. Clicking the floor tiles generates waves that push the ball along. Multiple clicks produce intersecting waves that will accumulate and make taller waves. Leap over chasms, jump walls, and walk along perilous pathways.
