Meat makes us go!

This is physics puzzle game inspired by the ridiculousness of the human body and my surprise at seeing the frailty of the human body in 2nd
grade health class.  The goal is to drive a ball to the black square exit on the level. Clicking on the floor tiles will generate a wave that 
will push the ball along.  Multiple clicks that produce intersecting waves will accumulate and make taller waves.  Leap over chasms, jump 
walls and walk along perilous pathways.

This game was made for the 2013 Global Game Jam along with RunJumpDev by Al Baker, Tim Knowlton, and Matheiu Keith.
